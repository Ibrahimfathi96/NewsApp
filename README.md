News App is Completely Finished. The app consists mainly of 6 different News Categories and sidebar for back to categories and change app language.
every category has multipale sources to display the news according to the main source.
you can see the news brief and also can go to see the full article.
you can search for specific topic or news.
I used News Api and localizations package, Provider and bloc each has its own implementation 
practiced later on mvvm with provider and also with bloc
**Note: check all the repo's branched for full updated code and take a look at the app demo.
